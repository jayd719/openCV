    "thresh_binary_inv": "Internally, this thresholding type compares each pixel intensity with the given threshold. If the intensity is greater than the threshold, the pixel value is set to 0 (inverted behavior of binary thresholding). If it is less than or equal to the threshold, the pixel value is set to the maximum value (255 by default). The operation effectively inverts the binary threshold mask, making high-intensity areas black and low-intensity areas white. This operation is fast and efficient, as OpenCV optimizes pixel-wise thresholding using vectorized operations over the image matrix.",
    "thresh_trunc": "For thresh_trunc, each pixel is compared with the threshold. If the pixel intensity is greater than the threshold, it is set to the threshold value. Otherwise, the pixel retains its original intensity. This thresholding method essentially flattens all intensity values above the threshold to a single constant while preserving lower values, making it useful for suppressing high-intensity regions. Internally, OpenCV scans the image matrix, applying a per-pixel comparison and substitution using efficient array processing techniques."
